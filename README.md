# ES6 Safe Promise

A native promise wrapper that automatically supports the handling of errors in your callback instead of swalling them silently.  
Let the errors bubble up to your console from your Promises!

## Installation

```bash
npm install safe-promise
```

```Javascript
var Promise = require('safe-promise');
```

## Requirements

 * A node engine natively supporting Promises.
 * that's all
